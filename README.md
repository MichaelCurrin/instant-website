# Instant website
> Create a webpage with custom text and images instantly - just change the URL query parameters.

I was frustrated at the time it takes to create a new website on a whim, resorting to creating a site from a template or existing site and changing the content or Jekyll config. Then I realized that a single website can look however you wish it to using JavaScript to make it dynamic. Supply your parameters in the URL and the app will use the content to build a webpage in your browser.

The idea is to use a form tool to turn your inputs into a URL, which you can then share with others.
