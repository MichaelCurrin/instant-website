A simple one-page React app which lets you build a landing page for a brand using a form. And you can share the page using the URL as it has all the details in the params.

This is my first React app and could do with refactoring when I get round to it but now I am just stoked to see that it works how I want and is shareable.

## Contributing

There are a lot of issues on the repo - some might never get done or make the others unneeded when a choice is made. I am happy with the how the single page site works for now and am adding to the Wiki for now to keep things simple. Please update the Wiki's [Showcase](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/instant-website/wiki/Showcase) section with your own creations if you want to share them.

If you do make a PR against this repo's `master` branch, you'll get a Netlify preview URL so you can **preview** your result on the existing Netlify app.

You must include a copy of the source license in your own repo if you use a substantial part of the code - if you copy a few lines here or there or just take inspiration then you don't need to worry but please still give credit back to this project.

If forking as a separate project (not to contribute), please copy `LICENSE` to `LICENSE-source` to keep the original license and then you can add your own `LICENSE` file.

This project was created for hobby use for myself and friends and people who stumble on it to play with and prototype with. This is not intended to be used for commercial use. You may fork this project and use some or all of it, but you give credit in your docs and on the site to link back to the original Instant Website repo.

It's my first React app so the React might not be so good but hopefully you can find parts you can reuse in your own app such as forms or query parameters or pullin in a random image.
