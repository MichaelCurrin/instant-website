# Instan website docs

## Where the idea came from

I was frustrated at the time it takes to create a new website on a whim. I had a flow using a base HTML page or a Jekyll site which a config, but I wanted it to be faster.

Then I realized that a single website can look however I wish it within seconds by using _JavaScript_ to make it dynamic.

So I found a way to build a webpage in the browser, using a template page I created and some URL query parameters to configure it. For ease of use over editing the URL directly, I added a form input which generates the page and the URL. An easy do this is with React.

The appearance of the site is kept simple - some text and some images, with a fixed layout.
